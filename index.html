        Views is Drake’s fourth studio album.<br /><br />
        Drake announced on August 6, 2014 that the title of his next album would
        be Views From The 6.<br />
        Drake would shorten it to VIEWS closer to the album release to make it
        less Toronto-centric, because The 6 is a nickname for Toronto, coming
        from the city’s two major area codes.
